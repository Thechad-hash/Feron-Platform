# FERON Platform - Full 3-Page UI Deployment Guide

This guide walks through deploying the full FERON platform with 3 frontends (Pages 1–3) and a shared backend. Each frontend is deployed via **Vercel**, and the backend is hosted on **Railway**. All components are integrated and ready for real-world testing and demos.

---

## 🚧 Project Structure (Monorepo)

```
/feron-platform
├── feron-live-client/         # Page 3 - FERON chat frontend
├── trial-license-ui/          # Page 1 - Trial License UI
├── smart-contracts-ui/        # Page 2 - Model Registration UI
├── feron-live-server/         # Backend - OpenAI + Express
├── feron-ethereum/            # Smart contracts (already deployed)
```

---

## ✅ Step 1: Final Local Prep (Already Complete)

Each frontend/backend folder should have:

* A standalone `package.json`
* `.env` file (locally only; use platform vars in prod)
* References to the correct VITE API or OpenAI key
* No localhost references remaining

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Deploy Frontends (Vercel)

Repeat the following for **each frontend**:

### A) Trial License UI (Page 1)

* Root directory: `trial-license-ui`
* Framework: Vite
* Build Command: `vite build`
* Output Directory: `dist`
* Env Vars: *(if any)*

### B) Smart Contract Registration UI (Page 2)

* Root directory: `smart-contracts-ui`
* Framework: Vite
* Build Command: `vite build`
* Output Directory: `dist`
* Env Vars: *(if any)*

### C) FERON Chat UI (Page 3)

* Root directory: `feron-live-client`
* Framework: Vite
* Build Command: `vite build`
* Output Directory: `dist`
* Env Vars:

  * `VITE_API_URL=https://feron-backend.up.railway.app`
  * `FERON_TIER=0`

Each deployed app will receive its own public Vercel URL.

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Deploy Backend (Railway)

### Railway Settings:

* Root Directory: `feron-live-server`
* Start Command (in `package.json`):

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js"
}
```

### Environment Variables:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
* Leave PORT empty (Railway will inject)

### In `server.js`:

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`FERON backend running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

CORS config should allow:

```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://feron-chat-live.vercel.app'
}));
```

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Integrate and Connect

### Page 3 (Chat)

* Uses `VITE_API_URL` to call `fetch(`\${VITE\_API\_URL}/api/feron`)`

### Page 1/2

* Use MetaMask wallet connection to interact with deployed Ethereum contracts
* Contract addresses and ABIs are baked into logic (no backend needed)

---

## 🧪 Final Checks Before Testing

* [x] All frontend folders deployed to Vercel with correct root
* [x] Backend deployed to Railway
* [x] Frontend points to correct VITE\_API\_URL
* [x] Backend CORS allows frontend domain
* [x] No `localhost` in any frontend fetch() calls
* [x] All apps working with live URLs

---

## 📎 Optional Enhancements

* Tier access logic (gated file upload)
* Admin dashboard
* License validation from contract
* Uploads routed to IPFS or local handling

---

## 💬 Support

For issues with:

* Vercel: frontend deployment, env vars, Vite config
* Railway: backend errors, env var issues, port binding
* GitHub: repo integration

Start with the service where the issue occurs. For backend-level errors, **Railway** support is your go-to.

Once all three UIs and the backend are live, you can begin structured testing with shops and early adopters!
